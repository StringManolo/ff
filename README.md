# ff
Fast Framework. A javascript basic framework made by me.

## What is this?
This is a small .js file what allows you to use some basic features in your web page/app.  
+  There is a router intended to make SinglePageApplications.  
+  Basic mustache sintax to replace {{ myVariable }} by text or {{{ myVariable }}} by html code.  
+  Custom tags like ```<myTag></myTag>``` can be used in the html and will be filled with the content of a property/variable.  
+  Kebab sintax like ```<my-tag></my-tag>``` will be filled by the contents of a text file named mytag.ff
+  Some shortcuts like $() to use querySelector or ael() to use addEventListener.
Check the index.html for mores examples of usage. 

## What is this good for?  
Is good for basic and small webpages what makes no sense to include big frameworks/libraries when you only need some basic features.  
Or to have some organized templates/components in files and test them easily without a full featured framework.  
Build your own framework from a small base.

## How to use.
You only need download the ff.js file or use this link [http://fastframework.ga/ff.js](http://fastframework.ga/ff.js)  
The index.html is an example of how you can use the available features.

#### Project is new.
You should minify to improve download time and host in CDN or alike to load the code from cache. 
You don't need to since the framework/library is really small. Be carefull of bugs and incompatibility. If you find any problems or sugestions please report them. You can do it directly using telegram @stringmanolo

#### The minified version seems to work but didn't test it.
If you need more speed, manually minify it. I'm not doing it yet since i may add lot of features or changes.
