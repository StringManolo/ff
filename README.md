# ff
Fast Framework. A javascript basic framework made by me.

## How to use.
You only need the ff.js file. 
The index.html is an example of how you can use the available features.

##Project is new, you should minify to improve download time and host in CDN or alike to lead from cache. 
You don't need to since the framework/library is really small.
