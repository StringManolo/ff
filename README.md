Fast Framework. A javascript basic framework made by me.

## How to use.
You only need download the ff.js file or use this link [http://fastframework.ga/ff.js](http://fastframework.js)

### Project is new.
You should minify to improve download time and host in CDN or alike to lead from cache. 
You don't need to since the framework/library is really small. Be carefull of bugs and incompatibility. If you find any problems or sugestions please report them. You can do it directly using telegram @stringmanolo
